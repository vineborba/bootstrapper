# Bootstrapper

This project is meant to be a study case of the Rust Programming Language and it's capability to make CLI tools.

It might grow to be a serious tool to be used in specific cases in the future, but it's not guaranteed it will ever become reality.

With that being explained, this will be separated in three main packages, which will be developed as time goes on. Those are:

- Degit
- Bootstrapper
- TUI

## Packages

### Degit

State: WIP

A simple CLI rewrite of the famous [degit](https://github.com/Rich-Harris/degit/) tool.
It currently provides only a simple clone and `degitfication` of repos from GitHub and GitLab.

## Bootstrapper

State: TBD

A CLI that will get info on the project to be created and make necessary procedures to create all the initial boilerplate.

## TUI

State: TBD

A Terminal UI layer for the Bootstrapper CLI, making a guide to the whole process.
